By using the CALLUMGAMES Discord bot (the "Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not invite or interact with the Bot.

2. Usage
You may use the Bot for personal, server, or community use, so long as that use does not violate Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

3. Data and Privacy
The Bot may store minimal data such as server IDs, message content (for logging or automation), or user IDs, only if necessary for functionality (e.g., moderation, configuration).

We do not sell, share, or misuse your data. You can request deletion of stored server-specific data at any time by contacting us via Discord.

4. Liability
The Bot is provided “as-is”. CALLUMGAMES is not responsible for any direct or indirect damage caused by the use (or misuse) of the bot.
